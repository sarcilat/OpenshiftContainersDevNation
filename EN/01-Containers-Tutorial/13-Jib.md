# Jib

[Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) builds optimized Docker and OCI images for your Java applications without a Docker daemon - and without deep mastery of Docker best practices.

---
## Building an Image

Weâ€™ve provided a simple Spring Boot application to containerize using Jib. Go to the application directory:

```bash
cd apps/greeting
```

Then run the following Maven command to build and push the container without using any Docker host:

```bash
./mvnw compile com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:3.0.0:build -Dimage=quay.io/<your-user>/greetings:1.0.0
```

Change `quay.io` for your container repository location (ie `docker.io`) and `<your-user>` for your user id.

And the output should be similar:

```text

> **TIP:** No credentials are required as they are taken from `~/.docker/config.json` if they are not set.
