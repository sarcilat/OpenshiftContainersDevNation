# Buildah

[Buildah](https://buildah.io/) can be used to build container images compliant with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) image specification. Images can be built based on existing images from scratch and using Dockerfiles.

Buildah only offers a binary file for Linux, so to make the tutorial generic, we use the buildah container image as a standard way to run buildah.

> **TIP:** Buildah is a dockerless technology; you donâ€™t need any Docker Host to build a container image.

---
## Preparation

In a terminal window, start the container having `buildah` installed:

```bash
podman run -it --device /dev/fuse:rw --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --security-opt apparmor=unconfined quay.io/buildah/stable:latest bash
```

---
## Creating a Container Image

Create a `Dockerfile` file, for this simple example, type `vi Dockerfile` and copy the content shown in the snippet:

```bash
FROM alpine:3.17.3

CMD ["echo", "'Hello World'"]
```

Then exit `vi` (no joke, please) by typing `:wq!`. When you are back in the shell, use buildah to build the container:

> **Tip:** remember to change `<your-user>` tag on the following commands, for the username that you created on [quay.io](https://quay.io).

```bash
buildah build -t quay.io/<your-user>/my-repository/hello:latest
```

```

The image is committed to local machine but not pushed to container registry.

```bash
buildah images
```

```bash

```

## Pushing a Container Image

To push the image to the container registry, first you need to log-in to the repository. On the previous steps you already do that with `podman`, but remember that at this moment you are not at your local machine, instead, you are in a container with `Buildah` deployed over there.

```bash
buildah login quay.io
```

Then you need to register your username and password of [quay.io](https://quay.io).

```text
Username: <your-user>
Password: <your-password>
Login Succeeded!
```

Now you can push the image to the container registry:

```bash
buildah push quay.io/<your-user>/my-repository/hello docker://quay.io/<your-user>/my-repository/hello:latest
```

By default, `buildah` reads credentials from `~/.docker/config.json`, but since this is a fresh container, credentials must be provided.

A Linux container has been created and pushed to the registry from another Linux container. You can stop the `buildah` container by typing `exit`. You can see the changes on [quay.io](https://quay.io) site
